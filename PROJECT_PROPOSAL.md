# ✨ Civic Lens: Illuminating Indian Democracy

*> "An intelligent companion for every citizen to understand, engage with, and master the intricate tapestry of Indian Governance."*


## 1. The Vision
**Civic Lens** isn't just a learning platform; it's a living guide. In a democracy as vast as India's, information is often fragmented or overwhelming. Civic Lens uses advanced AI agents to curate a personalized journey for every user. It transforms dry Civics lessons into a vibrant, interactive narrative that adapts to *you*.

From the Gram Panchayat to the Parliament, we empower citizens to see the full picture.


## 2. The Agentic Heart
Our system is powered by a symphony of specialized AI agents, each dedicated to a specific aspect of the learning experience.

### 🦉 The Librarian (Ingestion Agent)
*"I bring order to chaos."*
*   **Mission**: To bring order to massive amounts of information. It processes PDFs of Acts, Excel sheets of election data, and constitutional texts, organizing them into a pristine Knowledge Graph.
*   **Superpower**: **Intelligent Auto-Tagging**. It reads a document, understands its nuance, and tags it by "Complexity" (Level 1-15) and "Topic" (e.g., *Union Executive*), ensuring the right content finds the right learner.

### 🧐 The Examiner (Assessment Agent)
*"I help you know yourself."*
*   **Mission**: To understand the user's current standing without judgment.
*   **Method**: It crafts dynamic conversations and quizzes. It doesn't just check for "Correct/Incorrect" - it analyzes *why* you answered that way, building a deep profile of your strengths and gaps.

### 🧭 The Guide (Tutor Agent)
*"I light the path ahead."*
*   **Mission**: To curate your next step.
*   **Method**: Based on what The Examiner finds, The Guide fetches the perfect "Lesson of the Day"—content that is challenging enough to grow you, but accessible enough to understand. It turns "Weak Areas" into "Works In Progress."

### 🗞️ The Reporter (Local Lens Agent)
*"I keep you connected."*
*   **Mission**: To bridge the gap where English media falls short.
*   **Feature**: **The Local Lens**. This agent subscribes to hyper-local, vernacular news sources. It translates and distills complex local stories into **"crisp news bits"** in English (or your preferred language).

### 🔎 The Analyst (Q&A Agent)
*"I find the answers."*
*   **Mission**: To satisfy your curiosity with depth and data.
*   **Feature**: **Deep Dive Q&A**. Ask questions like *"Why was this bridge project delayed?"* or *"What are the arguments against this new Bill?"*. The Analyst doesn't just rely on internal data; it browses the live internet, synthesizes multiple perspectives, and provides a comprehensive, cited answer.

## 3. The User Experience

### 🟢 For the Admin (The Knowledge Hub)
A powerful command center to feed the system.
*   **Upload & Forget**: Drag-and-drop complex government documents. The Librarian handles the rest.
*   **Quality Gate**: A human-in-the-loop interface to review and refine the AI's understanding.

### 🔵 For the Citizen (The Dashboard)
A beautiful, glassmorphic space that feels clear and modern.
*   **The Journey**: A visual, gamified path from Level 1 (Novice) to Level 15 (Statesman).
*   **The Local Lens**: A live feed of project updates relevant to the user's area.
*   **Smart Revision**: Examples and quizzes that pop up just when you're about to forget a concept.

## 5. Data Strategy & Sources
To ensure "Civic Lens" remains the single source of truth, we rely on a tiered data sourcing strategy.

### 🥇 Tier 1: The Raw Truth (Official Sources)

*   **Judgments**: Supreme Court (supremecourt.gov.in).

### 🥈 Tier 2: Structured Learning (Pedagogy)
*Used by 'The Guide' to structure lessons.*
